      The importance of fashion in todayâ€™s society is greatly understood. 
      The way you look and dress is the first impression that people will have of you and 
      this means that you will need to be dressed in a way that fits your fashion sense, but also compliments you. 
      Fashion is a great way to state who you are and what you really stand for.
